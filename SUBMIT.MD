# Submit the homework

In this section, you find the instructions to submit your group assignment.

## When?
Homework 1 is due on [October 15th](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2023). Any homework submitted after the deadline will be subjected to a penalization with the following schema:

|   Delay  | Penalisation |
|:--------:|:------------:|
|  1 day |     -0.5     |
| 2 days |      -1      |
| 3 days |      -2      |
| 4 days |      -3      |
| 5 days |      -4      |

If you have particular problems respecting the deadline, please contact Aris directly (putting @Daniel in cc), explain your situation clearly, and mention your working group.


The maximum score you can get is 5.

## Where?
1. Each student must create a GitHub repository: follow these [steps](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-HW4/blob/master/README.md) (replace ADM-HW4 with the name you give to the repository).

2. Before the deadline, you can push in the repository whatever you want. Any push after the deadline will be taken into account for the penalization.

__Note__ :

* The state of the repository at the deadline time corresponds to your submission.
* __[IMPORTANT]__ To submit the HW you must compile this [form]().

## What?

The content of the repository is up to you. The mandatory files are:

* `README.md`: a Markdown file that explains the content of your repository. This is an [example](https://github.com/CriMenghini/Wikipedia/tree/master/Mention). You must say what it contains for each file/folder. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) a cheatsheet to use Markdown.
* `scripts.py`: a .py file that contains any solution of the exercise you completed, with this structure:

----------------------------

**\# Name_Exercise_1**

script_exercise_1

...

**\#Name_Last_Exercise**

script_last_exercise

----------------------------

Alternatively, you can produce a Jupyter Notebook, where each cell contains an exercise.

* `stamps/`: list screenshots or PDFs assessing your successful exercises. Review [this file](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/blob/master/2023/Homework_1/How%20to%20generate%20the%20PDF%20file%20with%20the%20submissions.pdf) to understand how to get PDF of your submissions.

It __must not__ contain:

* The datasets you used (thus, you should clearly state in the readme what dataset you used, if any, not in the homework description). That's because git allows you to push only datasets smaller than a maximum size. [Here](https://haydar-ai.medium.com/learning-how-to-git-ignoring-files-and-folders-using-gitignore-4b6a1ec43ce1) a good Medium's post that tells you how to deal with files/directories you do not want to push on GitHub.
